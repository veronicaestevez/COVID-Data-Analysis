# COVID-19 Data Analysis

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis repository!

This project involves analyzing extensive COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The dataset includes comprehensive information from early January 2020 to the present, covering various crucial aspects such as:

- **Population Data**: Population statistics for different countries and regions.
- **COVID-19 Deaths**: Detailed records of COVID-19 related deaths.
- **Vaccination Rates**: Progress and coverage of vaccination efforts globally and regionally.
- **Hospitalizations**: Data on hospital admissions due to COVID-19.
- **Other Metrics**: Additional relevant data for a thorough analysis.

## Data Processing and Analysis

The raw data was initially downloaded from Our World in Data and reformatted in Excel to streamline the analysis process. SQL was then used to conduct a detailed exploration and derive meaningful insights from the cleaned data.
